# Air Traffic Control System Simulation
 ## Developped in Python

- `main.py`: initialization, main logic and while loop
- `models.py`: stores all classes and helper functions
- `simulation.py`: pygame contents and functions used to visualize the simulation
- `statuses.py`: stores helpful variables that are used to track the status of planes and runways

### ATC System Requirements
The system must:
- Keep track of all airplanesâ€™ positions (latitude, longitude) within the traffic control zone.
- Queue airplanes for landing based on time of arrival into the traffic control zone.
- Command airplanes to go for landing (when it is their turn) to one of two runways (can be scaled to many).
  - Otherwise command airplanes to fly in a circular 'holding pattern' which is a circle with a radius of 1km around a suitable point.
- Never allow for planes to come within 100m of each other, whether
flying or landing.
- The traffic control zone is a circle of radius 10km (can be variable).

## Project Demos
- Preview the base project [here](https://youtube.com/shorts/Q8XtgZZPKBc) 
- Check out a more complex demo with 4 runways [here](https://youtube.com/shorts/lfpIuY2W5os)

NOTE: All demo media have the planes moving at 2-4x regular speed.
